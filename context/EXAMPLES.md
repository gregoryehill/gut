- Season: Winter
- Servings: 6
- Fat: Butter
- Foundation: Onion, carrot, celery
- Feature: Beef chuck
- Flavor: Red wine, beef stock
- Finish: Fresh thyme, Dijon mustard, flaky salt

**Output:**

### Red Wine Braised Beef with Mustard and Thyme

The kind of hands-off cooking that rewards patience with falling-apart meat and a sauce worth mopping up.

**Ingredients**

- 3 pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch pieces
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 large onion, diced
- 3 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 3 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 bottle dry red wine (something you'd drink)
- 2 cups beef stock
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- Flaky salt to finish

**Instructions**

1. Heat oven to 325°F. Season beef generously with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat. Brown beef in batches, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.

2. Add onion, carrots, and celery to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and starting to color, about 8 minutes.

3. Pour in wine, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to a simmer and let reduce by half, about 10 minutes.

4. Return beef to the pot. Add stock and thyme. The liquid should come about two-thirds up the meat. Bring to a simmer, cover, and transfer to oven.

5. Braise until beef is fork-tender, about 2½ to 3 hours. Remove thyme stems. Stir in Dijon mustard and season with salt.

6. Serve in shallow bowls, finished with flaky salt. Crusty bread is mandatory.

3. Add feta in large chunks — don't crumble it too much. You want creamy bites.

4. Squeeze lemon over, scatter dill on top, and finish with flaky salt and pepper.

5. Serve immediately, or let sit for 10 minutes to let flavors meld. Good with warm pita.
